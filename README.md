# pointcloud-clustering-detector-cuda
A CUDA-accelerated point cloud clustering detector for real-time 3D perception. This project implements fast clustering algorithms on the GPU to detect objects from LiDAR or depth sensor data. By leveraging parallelism, it significantly reduces computation time compared to traditional CPU-based methods.
