    // --- CUDA IMPLEMENTATION STEPS ---
    // 1. Allocate device memory for points and cluster labels.
    // 2. Copy host point cloud data to the device.
    // 3. Launch the CUDA kernel to perform clustering.
    // 4. Copy the cluster labels back from the device to the host.
    // 5. Post-process on the host to group points by their cluster labels and create point clouds.

    // This is a conceptual implementation. A full, performant CUDA clustering
    // algorithm is non-trivial and often uses more advanced techniques than this basic example.

    // For now, we will just return an empty vector to compile.
    // Replace this with your CUDA code when you are ready to implement it.
